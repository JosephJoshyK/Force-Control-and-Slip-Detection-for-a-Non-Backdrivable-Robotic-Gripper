# Force Control and Slip Detection for a Non-Backdrivable Robotic Gripper

## What the Project Does

This project focuses on the development and implementation of a force control and slip detection system for a non-backdrivable robotic gripper. The system aims to enhance the gripper's ability to handle objects with varying levels of grip strength, ensuring that it can securely hold items without causing damage. The project includes the following components:
- Force control algorithms to adjust the gripping force based on real-time feedback.
- Slip detection mechanisms to identify when an object is slipping and adjust the grip accordingly.
- Experimental validation and testing of the system using various objects and scenarios.

## Why the Project is Useful

This project is particularly useful for applications in industrial automation, where precise handling of delicate or variable objects is critical. The ability to control grip force and detect slip in real-time can:
- Reduce damage to sensitive components.
- Improve the efficiency and reliability of automated handling systems.
- Enable the gripper to adapt to a wide range of objects, increasing its versatility.
